   finish this task.

9. Minimum Spanning Trees (Avinash) - Started working on simulation,
   60% functionality is done. Needs 2 weeks time to finish this
   experiment.


Task 2: Functional Testing for Data Structures Lab (Sravanthi) - Done

Task 3: Collate the list of technologies for the 20 labs for Giritej
(Sadhana) - Done 

Taks 4: Functional Testing for computer programming lab (Khushpreet) -
Done 

Task 5: Find NPTEL lect on c programming (Khushpreet) - Done

Task 6: Automation Script (Siddharth) -

Installed various virtual machines to test script. The response by the
VMs was pretty slow, so testing the automation script could not be
done this week.

Tested the script successfully on the following machines:

1. Ubuntu 14.04, with nothing installed in it(scratch).
2. Ubuntu 14.04, with previously installed versions of java ans flash.
3. Fedora 20 , with nothing installed in it.
4. Fedora 20, with previously installed versions os java and flash.

Java is getting installed/updated successfully in the above
cases. There is flash plugin problem with some experiments. Need to
work on the same problem.  The script still needs to get tested on
other systems too like CentOS machine, etc.
